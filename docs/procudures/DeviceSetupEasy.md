Start with Mac or Linux, if using Windows, WSL2 has to be installed
Docker plus the legacy build package needs to be loaded on your host 
computer along with Thonny or your favorite Python IDE that works with
Micropython and a terminal program, I like Terminator because you can
split the pane horizontally, this is very helpful in the steps below

In the project directory on the host computer, run 


Attach your ESP32 device to a serial port and run

**sh flash**

This should load code into your device. 

On your host computer
