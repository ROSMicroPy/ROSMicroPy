I have also changed a line in /firmware/mcu_ws/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Client/CMakeLists.txt so now it says : 
set(UCLIENT_UDP_TRANSPORT_MTU 4096 CACHE STRING "Set the UDP transport MTU.") . This has changed nothing.

Hi @krm-mir,
The payload size is calculated at building time, when this file is generated:
https://github.com/micro-ROS/rmw-microxrcedds/blob/80a305b05dec7ff0954c91726db78418fbf07661/rmw_microxrcedds_c/src/config.h.in#L26

As you can see this is related with the RMW_UXRCE_STREAM_HISTORY, which you can modify on the CMakeFile and the RMW_UXRCE_MAX_TRANSPORT_MTU which is a value manage by Micro-XRCE-DDS and you can modify it on the next file: Micro-XRCE-DDS Config.

To clarify, the MTU on Micro-XRCE-DDS is the maximum size of data that can be sent on each packet. This value can be modified but having in mind that RMW_UXRCE_STREAM_HISTORY*RMW_UXRCE_MAX_TRANSPORT_MTU should be at least 2048.

RMW_UXRCE_STREAM_HISTORY
CONFIG_UDP_TRANSPORT_MTU.
